Title:
Network Configuration and Troubleshooting Using Cisco Packet Tracer

Objective:
The goal of this experiment is to design, configure, and troubleshoot a simple network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer. The experiment demonstrates the process of setting up devices, assigning IP addresses, configuring routing protocols, and testing connectivity between devices.

Equipment/Software:
Cisco Packet Tracer (software)
Devices: Routers, Switches, PCs, and Servers (within Packet Tracer)
Ethernet cables, Serial connections (virtual)
Network Topology:
The network consists of:

Two routers connected via a serial link.
Two switches, each connected to a router.
Two PCs connected to each switch.
Optional: A server connected to one of the switches.
Procedure:
Create Network Topology:

Place two routers, two switches, and four PCs on the workspace.
Connect the devices using the appropriate cables:
Router 1 to Switch 1
Router 2 to Switch 2
PCs to the corresponding switches
Use a serial connection between Router 1 and Router 2.
Configure Device Interfaces:

Assign IP addresses to each PC and router interface according to a predefined IP addressing scheme (e.g., 192.168.1.x for one network and 192.168.2.x for another).
Make sure subnet masks are correctly set, typically using /24 (255.255.255.0).
Routing Configuration:

On each router, configure static or dynamic routing (such as RIP or OSPF) to enable communication between different networks (i.e., the two networks connected to Router 1 and Router 2).
Verify Connectivity:

Use the ping command from one PC to check if it can reach the other PCs on the same and different networks.
Check the routing tables on the routers to ensure that routes are correctly configured.
Troubleshooting:

If the ping fails, troubleshoot by:
Checking cable connections.
Verifying IP addresses and subnet masks.
Checking routing configurations and protocols.
Ensuring that all interfaces are activated (no shutdown).
Results:
Successful communication between all devices indicates proper network configuration.
Analyze any failed ping tests and the troubleshooting process to resolve the issues.
Conclusion:
This experiment demonstrates how to set up and configure a simple network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It reinforces the concepts of IP addressing, routing protocols, and basic troubleshooting techniques in networking.
