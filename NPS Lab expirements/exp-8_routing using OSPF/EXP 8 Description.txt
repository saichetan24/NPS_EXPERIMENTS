Experiment: Configuring OSPF Routing Between Three Routers (Area 0)
Objective:
The goal of this experiment is to configure OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) dynamic routing on three routers to enable communication between two PCs located in different subnets. OSPF will be configured in Area 0, the backbone area.

Network Setup:
3 Routers: R1, R2, R3
2 PCs:
PC1 in Subnet 10.0.0.0/24
PC2 in Subnet 13.0.0.0/24
Subnet Allocation:
Subnet 10.0.0.0/24: PC1 and Router R1 interface
Subnet 11.0.0.0/24: Between Router R1 and Router R2
Subnet 12.0.0.0/24: Between Router R2 and Router R3
Subnet 13.0.0.0/24: PC2 and Router R3 interface
Network Topology:
scss
      
PC1 (10.0.0.1) ----> R1 ----> R2 ----> R3 ----> PC2 (13.0.0.1)
        (10.0.0.254)   (11.0.0.1)   (12.0.0.2)       (13.0.0.254)
Steps:
1. Create the Network Topology:
Place 3 routers and 2 PCs on the Cisco Packet Tracer workspace.
Connect PC1 to R1 and PC2 to R3.
Connect R1 to R2 and R2 to R3.
2. Assign IP Addresses:
On PC1, assign the IP address 10.0.0.1 / 24 and set the default gateway as 10.0.0.254.
On PC2, assign the IP address 13.0.0.1 / 24 and set the default gateway as 13.0.0.254.
Router R1:

Interface to PC1 (FastEthernet0/0):
perl
      
ip address 10.0.0.254 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
Interface to Router R2 (Serial0/0/0):
perl
      
ip address 11.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
Router R2:

Interface to Router R1 (Serial0/0/0):
perl
      
ip address 11.0.0.2 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
Interface to Router R3 (Serial0/0/1):
perl
      
ip address 12.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
Router R3:

Interface to Router R2 (Serial0/0/1):
perl
      
ip address 12.0.0.2 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
Interface to PC2 (FastEthernet0/0):
perl
      
ip address 13.0.0.254 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
3. Configure OSPF Routing on the Routers:
On Router R1:

Enable OSPF and assign interfaces to Area 0:
arduino
      
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
R1(config-router)# network 11.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
On Router R2:

Enable OSPF and assign interfaces to Area 0:
arduino
      
R2(config)# router ospf 1
R2(config-router)# network 11.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
R2(config-router)# network 12.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
On Router R3:

Enable OSPF and assign interfaces to Area 0:
arduino
      
R3(config)# router ospf 1
R3(config-router)# network 12.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
R3(config-router)# network 13.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
4. Verify OSPF Neighbors:
To verify that the routers have formed OSPF adjacencies, use the following command on each router:
sql
      
show ip ospf neighbor
Ensure that all routers display each other as neighbors.
5. Verify OSPF Routing Tables:
On each router, use the following command to check that OSPF routes have been learned:
sql
      
show ip route
You should see OSPF routes (marked with O) for each subnet.
6. Configure PCs for Default Gateway:
On PC1, set the default gateway to 10.0.0.254.
On PC2, set the default gateway to 13.0.0.254.
7. Test Connectivity:
Ping Test from PC1 to PC2:

On PC1, open the command prompt and ping PC2 (13.0.0.1):
      
ping 13.0.0.1
Ping Test from PC2 to PC1:

On PC2, open the command prompt and ping PC1 (10.0.0.1):
      
ping 10.0.0.1
8. Troubleshooting (if necessary):
