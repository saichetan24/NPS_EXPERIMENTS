EXP :  Configuration of FTP in Cisco packet tracer and verify the connection
1. Set Up the Network Topology
	Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
	Add the following devices to the workspace:
	One server (to act as the FTP server).
	One or more PCs (to act as FTP clients).
	One or more switches to connect devices (if needed).
	Appropriate number of cables to connect the devices.
2. Configure the IP Addresses
	Assign the following IP addresses:
	PC1: 10.0.0.1/24
	PC2: 10.0.0.2/24 (if you have more than one PC)
	Server: 10.0.0.3/24
To assign IP addresses:
	For each PC, click on the device and navigate to the Desktop tab.
	Open the IP Configuration option and set:
	PC1: IP address as 10.0.0.1, subnet mask 255.255.255.0
	PC2 (if used): IP address as 10.0.0.2, subnet mask 255.255.255.0
	For the Server, click the server device, go to the Desktop tab, and assign:
	Server: IP address as 10.0.0.3, subnet mask 255.255.255.0
3. Configure the Server (FTP Server)
	Click on the server device.
	Go to the Services tab.
	From the list of services on the left, select FTP.
	Ensure that the FTP service is turned ON.
	Add FTP users by providing a username and password (e.g., admin / password).
	Optionally, you can configure file settings such as upload/download permissions.
4. Verify IP Connectivity
	From any of the PCs, use the ping command in the Command Prompt to ensure connectivity to the server.
	Example: From PC1, run ping 10.0.0.3 (to test connectivity to the server).
	If the ping is successful, it confirms that the devices are on the same network and can communicate.
5. Access FTP from Client PCs
	Go to one of the PCs (FTP clients).
	Open the Desktop tab and launch the Command Prompt.
	Use the FTP command to connect to the server:
bash
Copy code
ftp 10.0.0.3
	When prompted, enter the username and password that you configured on the FTP server (e.g., admin / password).
	Once logged in, you can use basic FTP commands to download or upload files:
	To view files: ls or dir
	To download a file: get filename
	To upload a file: put filename
6. Additional FTP Commands
	Some useful FTP commands to test in Packet Tracer:
	ls: Lists files in the current directory on the server.
	get [filename]: Downloads a file from the server.
	put [filename]: Uploads a file to the server.
	bye: Disconnects from the FTP session.
