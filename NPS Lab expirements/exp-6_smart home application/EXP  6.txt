EXP  6: IoT Smart Home automation using cisco packet tracer
________________________________________
1. Set Up the Basic Network Topology
•	Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
•	Add the following devices to your workspace:
o	Wireless Router (to provide Wi-Fi connectivity).
o	Server (to manage the IoT devices).
o	PC (to monitor or control devices via the web or an IoT monitor).
o	Smart IoT Devices:
	Fan
	Light
	Garage Door
	Another Light
o	Connect the devices using the wireless network.
________________________________________
2. Configure the Wireless Router
•	Click on the wireless router and go to the GUI tab.
•	Under Basic Setup, configure the following:
o	IP Address: 192.168.10.1
o	Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
o	SSID: hello (Wi-Fi network name).
o	Wireless Security: Enable WPA2-PSK and set a password (e.g., "password123").
•	DHCP Settings: Enable DHCP so that other devices can automatically obtain IP addresses from the router. Ensure the IP range is within the 192.168.10.0/24 subnet.
________________________________________
3. Configure the Server
•	Click on the server device and go to the Desktop tab.
•	Open the IP Configuration:
o	Set the IP address to 192.168.10.1 (same as the router).
o	Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
o	Default Gateway: 192.168.10.1 (same as the router’s IP).
•	The server will act as the network controller for your IoT devices.
________________________________________
4. Configure the PC
•	Click on the PC and navigate to the Desktop tab.
•	Open IP Configuration and assign the following:
o	IP Address: 192.168.10.2
o	Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
o	Default Gateway: 192.168.10.1 (router’s IP).
•	This PC will be used to manage the smart home devices.
________________________________________
5. Add and Configure the IoT Devices (Fan, Lights, Garage Door)
•	Add the following IoT devices from the IoT Devices section in Packet Tracer:
o	Smart Fan
o	Smart Light
o	Smart Garage Door
o	Another Smart Light
•	Place them around the smart home and configure them to connect to the wireless network.
For each IoT device:
•	Click on the device.
•	Go to the Config tab.
•	Under Wireless, connect the device to the SSID hello and provide the Wi-Fi password you set earlier (e.g., "password123").
•	The device should obtain an IP address dynamically from the wireless router.
________________________________________
6. Connect Devices to the Network
•	Ensure all the devices (PC, Server, IoT devices) are connected to the SSID hello and have IP addresses in the 192.168.10.x range (use DHCP or manually configure IPs if necessary).
•	Confirm that each device is visible on the network:
o	You can ping the devices from the PC (e.g., ping 192.168.10.3 to check if the smart fan responds).
________________________________________
7. Control IoT Devices via the PC
•	From the PC, go to the Desktop tab.
•	Open the IoT Monitor application.
•	The connected IoT devices (fan, lights, garage door) should appear in the IoT Monitor interface.
•	You can now control the devices from the PC:
o	Turn on/off the lights.
o	Open/close the garage door.
o	Start/stop the fan.
________________________________________
8. Advanced Automation (Optional)
•	If you want to add automation (e.g., the lights turn on when it gets dark), click on the smart device (e.g., light or fan).
•	Go to the Programming tab and add event-based actions (e.g., set lights to turn on after 6 PM).
________________________________________
9. Testing the Setup
•	From the PC, open the IoT Monitor and interact with the devices:
o	Turn the fan on/off.
o	Open/close the garage door.
o	Control the lights.
•	Use the ping command to check network connectivity between the devices and the router or server.
