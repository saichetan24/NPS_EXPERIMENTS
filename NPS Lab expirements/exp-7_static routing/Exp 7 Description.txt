Experiment: Configuring Static Routing Between Three Routers
Objective:
The goal of this experiment is to configure static routing between three routers to enable communication between two PCs located in different subnets. The network consists of 4 subnets across the three routers, and the PCs are located at the ends of the network.

Network Setup:
3 Routers: R1, R2, R3
2 PCs:
PC1 in Subnet 10.0.0.0/24
PC2 in Subnet 13.0.0.0/24
Subnet Allocation:
Subnet 10.0.0.0/24: PC1 and Router R1 interface
Subnet 11.0.0.0/24: Between Router R1 and Router R2
Subnet 12.0.0.0/24: Between Router R2 and Router R3
Subnet 13.0.0.0/24: PC2 and Router R3 interface
Network Topology:
scss
    
PC1 (10.0.0.1) ----> R1 ----> R2 ----> R3 ----> PC2 (13.0.0.1)
        (10.0.0.254)   (11.0.0.1)   (12.0.0.2)       (13.0.0.254)
Steps:
1. Create the Network Topology:
Place 3 routers and 2 PCs on the Cisco Packet Tracer workspace.
Connect PC1 to R1 and PC2 to R3.
Connect R1 to R2 and R2 to R3.
2. Assign IP Addresses:
On PC1, assign the IP address 10.0.0.1 / 24 and set the default gateway as 10.0.0.254.
On PC2, assign the IP address 13.0.0.1 / 24 and set the default gateway as 13.0.0.254.
Router R1:

Interface to PC1 (FastEthernet0/0):
perl
    
ip address 10.0.0.254 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
Interface to Router R2 (Serial0/0/0):
perl
    
ip address 11.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
Router R2:

Interface to Router R1 (Serial0/0/0):
perl
    
ip address 11.0.0.2 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
Interface to Router R3 (Serial0/0/1):
perl
    
ip address 12.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
Router R3:

Interface to Router R2 (Serial0/0/1):
perl
    
ip address 12.0.0.2 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
Interface to PC2 (FastEthernet0/0):
perl
    
ip address 13.0.0.254 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
3. Configure Static Routes on the Routers:
On Router R1:

Add a static route to reach Subnet 12.0.0.0/24 and 13.0.0.0/24 via R2:
arduino
    
R1(config)# ip route 12.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 11.0.0.2
R1(config)# ip route 13.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 11.0.0.2
On Router R2:

Add a static route to reach Subnet 10.0.0.0/24 via R1:
arduino
    
R2(config)# ip route 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 11.0.0.1
Add a static route to reach Subnet 13.0.0.0/24 via R3:
arduino
    
R2(config)# ip route 13.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 12.0.0.2
On Router R3:

Add a static route to reach Subnet 10.0.0.0/24 via R2:
arduino
    
R3(config)# ip route 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 12.0.0.1
4. Verify Static Routes:
On each router, verify that the static routes have been configured properly using the following command:
sql
    
show ip route
5. Test Connectivity:
Ping Test from PC1 to PC2:

On PC1, open the command prompt and ping PC2 (13.0.0.1):
    
ping 13.0.0.1
Ping Test from PC2 to PC1:

On PC2, open the command prompt and ping PC1 (10.0.0.1):
    
ping 10.0.0.1
